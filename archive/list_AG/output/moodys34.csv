According to a published notice to security holders of Munson Steamship Line, a majority of the common stock of that company will be acquired upon completion of the capital readjustment plan (for details see under Munson Steamship Line, general index). On May 8, 1934, the Chancery Court at London, Eng., dismissed motion of International Mercantile Marine Co. for an injunction to prevent the Cunard-White Star shipping lines from merging. In denying affirmative justice to I. M. M. in delivering the decision, said that it was impossible to hold that I. M. M. was entitled to maintain the action, since a requisite of such a suit is that the plaintiff be a shareholder in the company. P. A. S. Franklin, president of I. M. M., is opposed to the merger, said that the White Star Line owned its modern sii-000,000 for thirty-six ships. He added that I. M. M. holds stock in the Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., owner of White Star Line collateral. In the notice we are told that I. M. M. was not a shareholder in the Oceanic, explaining that the shares in question were vested in the trustees, and that the American company's interests were limited to having the proceeds of the sale applied towards any money due it.",INTERNATIONAL MERCANTILE MARINE COMPANY,International Mercantile Marine Co.,,,"Company possesses valuable terminal facilities at Liverpool, London, Southampton, Antwerp and Hamburg...",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False
